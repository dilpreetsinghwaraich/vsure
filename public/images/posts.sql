The functionality will transfer any excess money in saving account beyond the specified limit to the Fixed deposit account of generally one year duration. In case, you need withdrawal anytime, the amount gets automatically credited back to your saving account from your Auto-FD account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sounds very interesting way to earn extra interest on your idle money! No need to visit branches! no need to do planning for fixed deposit and withdrawal!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s analyse does it really benefit the account holder and this ease of transaction really works for you.

The very thought of parking some amount in FD for a specified tenure helps you foresee the amount and tenure being parked in FD account.

Does it still make a good option for them?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the auto system, even though you have planned well but a good part of FDs will still be prone to shorter period interest rate which ranges between 4-6% only.

If one stays invested in Debt or Liquid mutual funds for more than 3 year, one can avail the indexation benefit which helps eliminating the tax burden on appreciation significantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Does it mean, this product is suitable for persons in higher tax bracket only?</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the benefits, it gives better post tax return and better way of handling the finances for an income tax assessee of any tax bracket.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Does the mutual funds investments also offers ease of transaction like auto bank FDs.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, there are many mutual funds available, wherein you get the money transferred to your saving account within 30 minutes of placing redemption request.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>What are the other benefits of parking the money in liquid mutual fund accounts?</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending upon the horizon of amount invested, one can sweep the money parked in liquid account to other debt or equity mutual funds very easily and also enjoy the ease of switching money easily to grab investment opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Are liquid funds safe in comparison to FDs?</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Liquid funds generally invest into money market instruments of very short duration.

One should never invest large amount of money in Endowment plans alone. Drawback being that they are long term plans within the range of 10-20 years, with a constant investing. Common mistake, often committed by taxpayers in hurry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the remedy would be to invest in term plans, which qualifies for tax deduction under Section 80 C.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Tax-exempt expenses</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Ignore the small things today and be ready to face larger problems tomorrow. People never pay attention that health insurance, children&rsquo;s tuition fees, house loan payments etc. qualify as valid tax deductions. Non-declaration of which cause them to pay more tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Remedy: Information is the key. Qualified tax deductions should be known to all. Claim all the deductions you can while not just only focusing on Section 80 C benefits.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>NPS</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Not just one&rsquo;s own savings but also employers contribution to NPS up to 10% of the employee&rsquo;s salary qualify for tax deduction under Section 80 CCD(2). Including NPS in your salary often wrongly deemed as a hefty task but it is not so when its benefits are made known to an employee.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Rajiv Gandhi Equity Savings Scheme and Infrastructure Bonds</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Investors with an annual income up to Rs 12 lakh can claim the benefits under RGESS under section 80 CCG. It would get the investor a deduction of 50% of the investment amount above 80 C limit for first three consecutive years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://calukeshsethi.in/2017/03/23/make-smart-investments-tax-saving/smart%20investment%20for%20tax%20saving\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.gstonlinefiling.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Smart-Investments.jpg\" style=\"height:322px; width:500px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Five-year Bank Fixed Deposit</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Eligible for deduction under Section 80C, another popular way to ensure tax deductions. People tend to invest in fixed deposits but the interest rate is quite low and also the interest earned is taxable which makes it a problem for tax-payers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, PPF(public provident fund) is a better option considering the higher interest rates and exemption of interest income from taxation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked from experts, they always emphasize on planning the tax according to one&rsquo;s overall portfolio. One should never put his money blindly in any asset. Planning is required in proper investment, it should never be taken light handedly. Plan the tax-saving investments before the start of the year, never leave them for the end moment. Always keep in mind, hasty decisions are the reasons for one&rsquo;s destruction.</p>', '', NULL, 'blog', NULL, NULL, 'publish', 'Template.SinglePost', 0, '2018-11-11 04:12:44', '2018-11-11 04:41:44'),

It has been seen that large multinationals can pump in a huge amount of products at lower prices; this has the ability to cripple the local manufacturing units. Anti-dumping duty is levied on the imported items in order to discourage the external manufacturers taking the lead in the domestic market.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Safeguard duty: </strong>When the Indian market is producing some items that are in direct competition with those produced by international players, then the government has been entrusted with the ability to put taxes on the imported goods. This tax would not allow the international exporters to throng the Indian market with their product and will allow the Indian industry to thrive in return.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>National Calamity Contingent Duty: </strong>This levying of this tax is purely a policy decision.

GST will subsume several indirect taxes and thus make the process of manufacturing as well as sales more profitable for the entrepreneurs.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Freedom from cascading taxation: </strong>As the GST model aims at creating a single tax at the centralized level as a replacement for the various taxes previously applied at central and state levels, the post-manufacturing issues due to cascading taxes would reduce. This means that the dealers or the distributors will not have to pay state taxes instead of the product, which would translate into improved profit margins.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Supply chain restructuring: </strong>The transportation of the items is largely delayed because of the queuing for taxation at the state boundaries. A centralized taxation would mean that the supply chain would be working in a smoother pattern. This would be particularly beneficial for the items that need to be consumed in a defined period like food items.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Improvement in MRP valuation: </strong>Due to the multiple taxes at different levels, the final retail price is generally greater than the ex-factory cost by multifold. Now when the taxation value would be reduced than the manufacturers would price their goods more competitively. This would be definitely helpful for them to capture a larger customer base.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Issues with GST:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Cash flow blockage: </strong>GST deems stock transaction as taxable. While this tax is available further as credit but this credit is usable only after the conclusive supply of the product. Thus the amount which has been paid at the GST level is blocked till the time of final sales. This could be really troublesome for new and smaller manufacturers with limited working capital.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Uncertainty about discounting:</strong> While the discounts and incentives are not taxable in the current system, there hasn&rsquo;t been any clarity about their status in the Model GST Law regarding this aspect. This disparity could be really problematic for the manufacturers who have to manage an extensive network of dealers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>GST is a new bird in the air; therefore it is quite difficult to predict the nature and the height of its flight.

It will merge several Central and State taxes into a single tax facilitating the national market. However, we must admit that we are still miles away from the implementation of the GST system. The four tax rates that the GST Council has adopted would proof an obstacle in the path to - one nation, one rate motto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key Factors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Tax rates fixed at 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Food grains will be zero-rated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Most goods, like washing machines, ACs, refrigerators, soap, etc. will be rated at 28%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Goods like luxury cars, pan masala, aerated drinks and tobacco products will be taxed at 28% plus cess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Views of Market Analysts Over the Impact of GST</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the proposed GST, tax rates on goods will decline. A significant proportion of goods is not even included in the tax system. At present, services-oriented components with 25-30% share in the CPI basket, includes housing, transport, and communication. However, these services are expected to remain exempt under GST. These proposals have forced the market analysts to worry about the impact of GST on inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reactions of Industry</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though many welcome the GST system but the introduction of the four-tier tax system is clouding their thoughts. Many worries that most of the consumer goods would fall in 18 percent tax rate. They also worry that the system would make the regime more complex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Effect</strong><strong> on GDP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked from Mr. Naushad Forbes about the effect of GST on GDP, he replied that according to him the new system is expected to increase the GDP by 1.5 to 2 percent but the new four rate system will surely reduce the benefits of GST and naturally the benefit will be less than 1.5-2 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Experts View</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though many tax experts are willing to welcome the new GST system with open hands yet, they have varying perceptions regarding the new system. According to Prashant Deshpande, the increase in marginal rates to 28% will attract items which are in low tax rates currently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the GST, as predicted, is expected to remove the complexity in the tax system of the country yet with the four-tier rate system is hard to digest by the people as it would, in turn, will bring complexity in the industrial regime. Also, it would hinder in the way to increase the GDP of the country. Exception of certain goods from taxation would certainly affect the economy.

There is only one issue in GST implementation i.e. tax structure or tax slabs which is to be decided on the next meeting of GST council scheduled on May 18-19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the introduction of GST, all the central government as well state government taxes will be subsumed into a single tax. Let&rsquo;s see which of the taxes will be accommodated within GST.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Central government taxes to be subsumed in GST are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Central excise duty</li>\r\n	<li>Additional excise duty</li>\r\n	<li>Service tax</li>\r\n	<li>Additional customs duty</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>State government taxes to be subsumed in GST are;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>State VAT/Sales tax</li>\r\n	<li>Entertainment tax</li>\r\n	<li>Entry tax</li>\r\n	<li>Purchase tax</li>\r\n	<li>Luxury taxes</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>Administration of GST</strong>:</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two components of GST i.e. CGST (Central GST) &amp; SGST (State GST) accounting for the fact that India has a federal structure of ruling. So both the governments i.e. centre and states will charge GST across the chain. Tax will be charged for every supply of goods as well as services. Centre would levy CGST and states would levy SGST on respective transactions. But the input tax credit for CGST as well as SGST can be used to discharge the CGST and SGST output liability. No cross transaction of tax credit is permitted.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>GST in Inter-state transaction of goods:</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>For all the inter-state transactions, central government would collect taxes under Integrated GST (IGST). The IGST is believed to be roughly a sum of CGST and SGST. This IGST mechanism is designed to flawlessly ensure flow of taxes from one state to another. It is the responsibility of central government to transfer the importing state credit of IGST used for payment of SGST.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>IT infrastructure for GST:</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>For the smooth &amp; functional implementation of GST in the country, both central and state government have created and registered Goods &amp; Services Tax Network (GSTN) as a non-profit and Non-government Company to provide IT services to government, taxpayers and stakeholders. The main objective of GST is to build an interface which is user friendly and efficient for taxpayers and government. GSTN is preparing and developing a state of art IT infrastructure for all the GST needs. This would ensure that all the taxes could be paid online, all the returns can be filed online without any manual intervention. The assessment of filed returns would be automatic.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>Benefits of GST:</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>For business and industry:</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Easy compliance</li>\r\n	<li>Uniformity of tax slabs</li>\r\n	<li>Removal of cascading</li>\r\n	<li>Gain to manufacturers and exporters</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>For central and state government:</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Simply and easy to administer</li>\r\n	<li>Better controls on leakage of flow</li>\r\n	<li>Higher revenue efficiency</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>For the consumer:</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Simple and transparent tax burden</li>\r\n	<li>Relief in overall tax burden</li>\r\n	<li>Automatic generation of returns</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'a:2:{s:5:\"title\";N;s:11:\"description\";N;}', 'public/images/uploads/2018/Nov/1541962194_GST - The revolutionary Tax Regime.jpg', 'blog', NULL, NULL, 'publish', 'Template.SinglePost', 24, '2018-11-10 18:59:47', '2018-11-29 04:13:50'),

Long term investment entail that the amount put into the business acts as a capital investment and does not return in the due course of business but allow the investor to hold a stake in the company i.e. equity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equity investment is one of the measures of generating long revenue and has the ability to provide the investor a relatively safely kept investment in the duly dynamic economic stratum. This is based on the fact that over the longer tenures of time, the value of money and stake do not deteriorate but usually ends up generating positive returns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The income tax calculations too are in favor of equity investment as the system has been devised in a way that it takes into account the money that sits virtually idle in the form of the equity. This allows the investor to avail certain tax benefits by the money invested in equity. Let us take a look at these benefits attached with equity investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Dividends: </strong>The Company in whose equity the investor owns the shares releases its profits and distributes it amongst the shareholders on the basis of the amount of equity held. This distributed amount is called dividend. The dividends earned off the domestic companies are totally tax-free in the bracket of 10-15 %. For the individuals in 25-35%, the tax is calculated at the rate 15 % while exceeding this income group the person is liable to pay tax at the rate of 20 %.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Capital gains: </strong>There are transactions amongst fellow share investors as well. When another person buys your share by paying a higher price than the regular market price, then this gain is called as capital gain in the economic terms. The government of India protects this amount gained by the investor from income tax, giving the share investor some extra earnings. The taxation for this is done at the rate of 15 %.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Capital loss: </strong>There are provisions that if an equity investor loses some money in the form of capital loss than this loss can be carried forward to utmost 8 years. This amount is shown in the form of debts and therefore reduces the payable taxes.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>ELSS: </strong>Section 80 C of the Income Tax Act allows a citizen to invest in the Equity Linked Savings Scheme. The amount invested in these schemes can be even from the other sources of income. This amount can border to Rs 1.5 lakhs in a financial year. It can be used to get tax deductions over the income earned.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Set off capital gains: </strong>The investor can set off capital gains i.e. the short term capital gains can be set off instead of any short-term capital loss by the investor.

The major advantage of this genre is that it allows the economic development of the individual or the group while also generating several opportunities for others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Freelancers are the professionals who have taken the self-employment genre to various aspects that conventionally had full-time employment options. Freelancers allow the business to reduce the usual logistics and employee retention costs. This is particularly important for the small and growing businesses. This increases the investment window for the business and has a positive effect on the overall economy of the country.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The subsequent Indian governments have been taking constant initiatives in order to enhance the trend of self-employment amongst the Indian citizens. Over the course of years, there have been a series of tax exemptions that have been forwarded to freelancers to encourage more of them to come into the fold. Some of the tax exemptions as well as important tax insights that are meant for the freelancers are listed below.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The income tax for the freelancers does not come under regular salary module, and thus the applicant can fill ITR 4 form for filing up the returns.</li>\r\n	<li>The amount earned by freelancing needs to be looked closely to understand the taxable portion. The taxable income shall be calculated after deducting the expenses like internet connection charges, telephone costs involved in client interaction, etc. Tax has to be calculated over this calculated amount instead of the total amount received through the invoicing.</li>\r\n	<li>There are several sections of the income tax act that qualify the freelancers for tax exemptions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Exemptions for qualified investments under Section 80 C are applicable for the freelancing professionals like bloggers and SEO experts.</li>\r\n	<li>Section 80 D and other sub-segments of the section allows several exemptions instead of the expense incurred in the medical treatment of self and those dependents on the freelancer.</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;Section 80 E allows the professional to receive tax exemptions on the grounds of education loan repayment.</li>\r\n	<li>Section 80 GG of the income tax act allows the professionals to claim the tax benefits over the payment of rent to an accommodation.</li>\r\n	<li>Several other tax exemptions are also enlisted under the same section like on the amount donated to a charitable trust and political parties etc.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Other tax exemptions allowed to the freelancers are in accordance with the salaried sections. The exemptions like on the interest of the amount in a savings account are applicable as well for the freelancers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The logic behind encouraging freelancers is that it enhances the industrious nature of the eligible professionals by giving them proper incentives in terms of taxation benefits. This would be instrumental in breaking the flawed belief that everyone needs a conventional job to succeed. Freelancing puts deep emphasis on the inhibitive ability of the professional to make out the maximum of the available opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The taxation benefits go a long way in making the freelancers believe in their work which helps exponentially in increasing their productivity and hence the incremental contribution to the development of the economy and the nation.&nbsp;</p>', 'a:2:{s:5:\"title\";N;s:11:\"description\";N;}', 'public/images/uploads/2018/Nov/1541963469_Freelancers.jpg', 'blog', NULL, NULL, 'publish', 'Template.SinglePost', 25, '2018-11-12 04:41:09', '2018-11-29 04:14:47'),
